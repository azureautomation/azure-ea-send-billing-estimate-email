Azure EA - Send Billing Estimate Email
======================================

            

Uses the Microsoft Azure Enterprise Agreement API to estimate your annual Microsoft Azure bill based on the last days usage.


The default Azure EA account is the sample account id and accesskey just so you can see it working before plugging your own details in.
You should use the Microsoft Azure Enterprise portal to request your own accesskey.


I recommend adding the script to a daily schedule.


This script requires a credential asset for the your SMTP server in order to send the email.


The email looks like this;

If every day were like today, your annual Azure bill would be...**£27977.25**Based on usage for 20 May 2015 (£76.65)

 


        
    
TechNet gallery is retiring! This script was migrated from TechNet script center to GitHub by Microsoft Azure Automation product group. All the Script Center fields like Rating, RatingCount and DownloadCount have been carried over to Github as-is for the migrated scripts only. Note : The Script Center fields will not be applicable for the new repositories created in Github & hence those fields will not show up for new Github repositories.
